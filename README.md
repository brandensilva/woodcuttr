Media-Queries-Debug-Tools
=========================

A simple js/css debug kit for media queries which is easy to use.

Simply include the css in your header, and the js before the closing body tag (after a version of jQuery is loaded) and viola!

The css file is designed to be manipulated as needed. Add your specific styles within the set queries and edit the params as needed.

###You can also toggle visiblity with the "T" key.

#####Example config within the head tag:

	<script src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.8.2/jquery.min.js"></script>
	<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="css-debug.css" />

#####Before the closing body tag:

	<script src="css-debug.min.js"></script>
